                <b>Abstract</b>: A classic problem is to find inequalities which are satisfied by polynomials of minors of any totally positive matrix. In 2000, Fallat and Johnson restricted the question to study multiplicative inequalities, an inequality that holds between two products of minors. This is equivalent to identifying the set of ratios of minors which are bounded as functions over the set of totally positive matrices. As these minors are cluster coordinates of cluster algebra, it is natural to generalize this question to an arbitrary cluster algebra. With M. Gekhtman and D. Soskin, we classified these bounded ratios over any finite cluster algebra. Surprisingly the extreme rays of the bounded cone are related to the "U-variables" used to define cluster configuration spaces.

                <b>Abstract</b>: Motivated by computational geometry of point configurations on the Euclidean plane, and by the theory of cluster algebras of type A, Sergey Fomin and Linus Setiabrata have recently introduced Heronian friezes - the Euclidean analogues of Coxeter’s frieze patterns.  I will explain the way these friezes arise from a polygon in the complex plane, and that a sufficiently generic Heronian frieze is uniquely determined by a small proportion of its entries. Then, I shall proceed to some of my results, that hold in the cyclic case, i.e.  when the vertices of the polygon are placed on the circle. Namely, I will speak about vanishing of certain determinants in the cyclic case, as well as explain some interesting algebraic relations that hold between the entries of the cyclic Heronian frieze.

                <b>Abstract</b>: In this talk we are discussing natural generalisations of SL(2,Z)-tilings to the multidimensional case. 
We employ geometrical methods to describe the analogue of tameness (decomposability) 
for different constructions of hypertilings and study necessary and sufficient conditions 
for hypertilings to be tame. In particular we show how tameness of hypertilings depends 
on Cayley’s hyperdeterminant.

                <b>Abstract</b>:  To a gauge quiver and a dimension vector, one can associate an algebra of quantum
differential operators D_q. The algebra D_q is constructed as the braided tensor product of
algebras associated to each edge, given by RLL-like relations similar to Fock-Rosly approach to
character varieties, but with different dimensions at each vertex. We relate such algebras to
stratified character varieties with parabolic line defects. We present a way to realize the algebra
for each edge inside an upper cluster algebra via transport matrices on a plabic graph.
Moreover, we explain how to obtain a cluster description of the whole algebra D_q by gluing
the cluster quivers of the different edges, whenever the gauge quiver is a tree. Quantized
multiplicative quiver varieties are obtained via quantum Hamiltonian reduction from D_q.

                <b>Abstract</b>:  We’ll begin by introducing Steiner systems, IBIS groups and matroids through the running example of the Fano plane. The fact that the Fano plane can be used to construct examples of these three objects is no coincidence, as will become clear when we look at a 1959 result of Hartmanis and a 1995 result of Cameron and Fon-Der-Flaass. Finally we’ll discuss the results of some ongoing explorations into these connections being carried out by Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda and me.

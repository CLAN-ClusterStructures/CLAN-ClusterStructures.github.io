                <b>Abstract</b>: An important technology in cluster theory is that of mutation, which provides a way of producing more rigid
                and cluster tilting objects from an initial one. Iyama and Wemyss introduced a concept which is closely related to
                this mutation: the mutation of modifying modules. In this talk, I will address the question of specifying precisely when
                the mutation of a modifying module is involutive. When this is the case, we are able to construct interesting 
                autoequivalences called the noncommutative twist and cotwist functors. I will discuss their construction and their properties.

                <b>Abstract</b>: Given an infinity-gon having a finite number of two-sided accumulation points, Igusa and Todorov defined
                                 a discrete cluster category of type A-infinity. The completion of this category was defined by Paquette and Yıldırım.
                                 Both categories are triangulated, have cluster-tilting subcategories, and have nice geometric models: their
                                 indecomposable objects can be regarded as arcs, or limits of arcs, of the infinity-gon. These geometric models allow
                                 to classify some important classes of subcategories using arc combinatorics. In this talk we will introduce the
                                 Igusa–Todorov discrete cluster category and the Paquette–Yıldırım completion, and we will discuss the classification
                                 of torsion pairs, t-structures, and co-t-structures in the completion.

                <b>Abstract</b>: Joint work with Eleonore Faber and Matthew Pressland. In their 2008 paper, Iyama–Yoshino introduced a reduction technique
                for 2-Calabi–Yau triangulated categories. This produces a new 2-Calabi–Yau triangulated category as a subquotient of the original category 
                in a way that works particularly nicely for cluster categories. We give a reduction technique that applies to stably 2-Calabi–Yau Frobenius
                extriangulated categories.  From this point of view, Iyama–Yoshino reduction can be recovered by moving to the corresponding stable categories.
                We also give an application to frieze patterns.
